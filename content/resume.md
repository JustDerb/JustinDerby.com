# Projects

## [Relliker - A fitbit Group Search Tool](http://www.relliker.com/)

**May 2012 - July 2014**

A website that provides searching capability for all [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com) users to search for groups that may interest them. Since the fitbit community website can ONLY list it's groups in alphabetical order, this helps solve the problem of iterating through 200+ groups in alphabetical order (which is never the best way to look for groups!).

The website is now defuct as the Fitbit team has released their own group search feature. They thanked me for the website and said that even the people inside the company used it before the actual search tool was released!

## Auto Panda

**July 2010 - October 2011**

A text-based service for Panda Express that allows anyone to text it with a survey code (given on any prior receipt) and it will fill out the survey and return the confirmation code, all while waiting in line for food. Filling out the survey gives the user a free entree with their order. The service piggy-backs off of Google's email service to provide SMS functionality.

## Wadsworth It!

**January 2012 - January 2013**

A over night project designed to explore the internet created 'Wadsworth Constant' (from Reddit.com)
Website now down, due to less interest and not wanting to pour money into a website that got no attention.

## [Is Derby In Iowa?](http://isderbyiniowa.com/)

**August 2015 - Present**

After a discussion with co-workers (and numerous plane flights from Seattle, WA to Iowa for weddings), they remarked that they never knew which weekends I'd be in Iowa. So the result was this website! Powered by AWS ROute 53, Static Website Hosting via AWS S3, and dynamic updates via AWS Lambda which periodically check my Google Calendar to update the site accordingly based on the presence of an event (in Iowa) or not (not in Iowa). It also comes with a convenient API (for no good reason): [http://isderbyiniowa.com/api/](http://isderbyiniowa.com/api/)

The cool thing with this simple website is there are no backend servers maintained by me since it is all hosted via S3!

## [Eyeris (Mobile Eye Tracking)](http://seniord.ece.iastate.edu/may1320/index.html)

**August 2012 - May 2013**

Senior Engineering Design project to design a mobile, real-time eye tracking solution. The problem statement:

Mobile Eye-Tracking glasses are needed to be able to determine where one is looking at any given point in time. There are currently no mobile solutions that track both eyes, which would allow for 3D eye-tracking. Also, very few mobile solutions allow real-time streaming. This would allow multiple people to watch a study as it is being conducted rather than analyzing the data afterwards. There exhibits a need to stream this over WiFi networks so that this is compatible with multiple platforms and applications.
